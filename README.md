Create a web site for which the main pages are public and offer the list of all who have graduated from UTEP CS department. Your site should also allow visitors to purchase items related to the department. In addition, hte graduates should have an account, and should be able to communicate to each other in a limited social networking environment.

In addition, your web site should integrate concepts from the course in a meaningful form. This includes server side scripting, client side scripting, SQL database access, AJAX, authentication, forms, sessions. It should implement security features we covered in class. In particular, it should be resistant to SQL injection and cross-site request forgery.

The web site should have the following characteristics:
1. Appealing look and feel. The pages should have a good layout, with some graphics and readable content.
2. Consistent look and feel, where all pages share a similar design and navigation scheme.
3. Easy to navigate.
4. Works on different browsers (test on at least 3 different browsers).
5. It should be the group's own work. Do not include packages or themes downloaded from the internet.

The Web site should have the following functionality:
1) Allow to display the list of graduates in different formates (by year, alphabetic, etc.)
2) Allow the visitor to filter the list with different criteria
3) Visitors can view the items that are available for purchase, add items to a cart, and purchase items using a simulated purchasing environment like the paypal sandbox.
4) Allow graduates to login and manage their profile. The graduates should be allowed (but not required) to upload a photo.
5) Require login to access the social networking part of the web site.
6) They should be allowed to change privacy setting to control what can be seen by friedns, by other graduates, public. The user selects a list of friends.
